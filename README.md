# LearnOpenGL Playground

Personal playground for the [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com) tutorials.

I initially tried to do it all in C89 before the introduction of GLM. And since I didn't feel like writing a whole linear algebra library in C, I decided to start over using modern C++.

# Dependencies

This assumes you have GLFW installed and CMake is able to find it.
